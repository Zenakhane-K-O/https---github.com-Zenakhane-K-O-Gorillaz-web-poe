        <h2>About Gorillaz Streetwear</h2>
        <p>
            Gorillas, founded by Jason Matthews at just 20 years old in 2015, began as a small passion project fuelled by a love for design and street culture. What started in a humble bedroom studio has since evolved into a recognized and influential urban streetwear brand. Known for its bold designs and cultural relevance, Gorillas blends high-quality craftsmanship, stylish aesthetics, and affordable pricing — making it a go-to label for the next generation of fashion-forward individuals.

            With a strong emphasis on creativity, authenticity, and inclusivity, the brand resonates with a diverse and global audience. Gorillas has successfully carved out its place in the competitive fashion landscape by staying true to its roots while embracing innovation. As it continues to expand internationally, the brand remains committed to evolving with the times, pushing boundaries, and inspiring self-expression through fashion. Gorillas is not just a brand — it's a movement, and it's poised for continued growth in the ever-changing world of streetwear and global fashion.

        <p>We’re more than just clothing — we’re a culture. Gorillaz Streetwear was founded to empower individuality, break boundaries, and keep it real on the streets of South Africa and beyond.</p>

        <h2>Our Vision, Mission & Values</h2>

            <div id="vision" class="accordion-content" style="display:none;">
                <p>
                    At Gorillas, our mission is to deliver high-quality, affordable, and trendsetting apparel tailored specifically for young individuals aged 16 to 35. We are passionate about creating more than just clothing — we aim to build a brand that empowers self-expression, celebrates individuality, and evolves with the lifestyles of our diverse community.
                
                    We design with intention, blending style, comfort, and cultural relevance to craft pieces that reflect the dynamic personalities of our customers. From the streets to social spaces, our fashion is made to inspire confidence and stand out, while staying rooted in the latest movements in global fashion.
                    
                    Accessibility is at the core of what we do. We believe that great style shouldn’t come with a high price tag — which is why we are committed to offering pieces that are not only on-trend, but also affordable and inclusive, without compromising on quality or design.
                    
                    Through every drop, campaign, and collaboration, Gorillas continues to push boundaries and redefine modern streetwear for a new generation of creatives, thinkers, and changemakers. Our mission is clear: to become a trusted voice in youth fashion, offering apparel that speaks your language and moves with your world.
